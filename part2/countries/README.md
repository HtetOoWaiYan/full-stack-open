## Setup Guide

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

### Getting started

In the project directory,

Run: **`npm i`** to install the dependencies.

Create **`.env`** file and add your [weatherstack API key](https://weatherstack.com) like:
```
REACT_APP_WEATHERSTACK_API_KEY=YOUR_WEATHERSTACK_API_KEY
```

This app also uses [REST Countries API](https://restcountries.eu), but you don't need an API key for that one.

Run the app in the development mode: **`npm start`**


Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.
